这里主要从两个层面进行总结

1. data acquisition

也就是直接读取的数据格式
1.1 Cartesian coordinates

Here, 3D laser measurement system is commonly stored as x, y and z. This represents the cartesian coordinates of the measured points in a coordinate frame originating at the scanner position.

1.2 Spherical coordinate system
An alternative method is to represent the points in the spherical coordinate system. The θ, ϕ, r represent the horizontal and vertical angles of measurement with the measured distance r. 

2. application

也就是从应用层面上，e.g for classifiaction,registration

2.1 directively operating on 3D point cloud

ICP

2.2 Features

local features and global features

2.3 NDT

2.4 Image

也就是把3D point cloud 转化为2D oimage 然后利用图像处理的方法

2.5 Voxelized grids

CNN
缺点
volumetric representation is constrained by its resolution due to data sparsity and computation cost of 3D convolution.

所谓的data sparsity 离Laser scanner近的地方数据密度大，远的地方稀疏
