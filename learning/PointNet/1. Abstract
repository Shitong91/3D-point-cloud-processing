1. 要解决的终极问题

Point cloud classification and segmentation

2. input and output

input: original 3D point cloud
也就是说直接对点操作，不需要转化
output: labeled points or labeled segments

Our PointNet is a unified architecture that directly
takes point clouds as input and outputs either class labels
for the entire input or per point segment/part labels for
each point of the input.

输出结果分为两种，对应两种应用场景

2.1 For the object classification task.

The input point cloud is either directly sampled from a shape or pre-segmented from a scene point cloud. Our proposed deep network outputs
k scores for all the k candidate classes. 



2.2 For semantic segmentation. 

The input can be a single object for part region segmentation, or a sub-volume from a 3D scene for object region segmentation. Our model will output n × m scores for each of the n points and each of the m semantic subcategories. 即逐点的lable
