这篇文章提到了一个 预训练的概念


step 1:
Pretraining / fine-tuning works as follows:

step2:
You have machine learning model 𝑚
step3:
Pre-training: You have a dataset 𝐴
on which you train 𝑚
step4:
You have a dataset 𝐵
. Before you start training the model, you initialize some of the parameters of 𝑚 with the model which is trained on 𝐴
.
step 5:
Fine-tuning: You train 𝑚
on 𝐵

    .

This is one form of transfer learning. So you can transfer some of the knowledge obtained from dataset 𝐴
to dataset 𝐵. See my Machine Learning Glossary for this and more terms explained in very few words.
