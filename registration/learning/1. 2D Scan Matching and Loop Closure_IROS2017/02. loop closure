1. loop closure的作用

Loop closure is a major component in the back-end graph optimization in the front-end / back-end framework of SLAM.

It helps to eliminate odometry errors that are accumulated in the front-end for long term operations.

总结：为后端消除累积误差

2. 当前关于loop closure的方法主要是corelation based approaches. 
也就是基于相关性的方法.

1)scan-to-submap
目前没有了解

2) bag-of-words
详见高博的书

3. Existing works on detecting loop closures

step1: designing proper feature extraction
step2: Nearest Neighbor search
step3: BoW retrieval

4. 本文的方法

we approach the 2D LiDAR loop closure problem as a classification
problem, to answer whether a pair of laser scans are captured
in nearby location. 

说是归结为一个分类问题，目前还是不太明白
