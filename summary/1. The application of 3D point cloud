1. Laser scanners 的作用
Modern laser scanners are able to measure the surface of objects in the environment.

They are capable of up to one million points per second
measuring the reflectivity and the distance of a surface. With the help of photogrammetry they
can also capture the color of the surface.

Laser scanners 获得物体的表面信息，这些信息包括reflectivity（反射率）和scanners 距离 objects的distance. 如果配套上相机图像，我们就可以获得带颜色的3D point cloud。

2. 3D point cloud的主要应用，也是我感兴趣的field
The captured data is used for the generation of 2D and 3D maps of the environment. These maps are used in the robotics field for autonomous navigation and exploration.
