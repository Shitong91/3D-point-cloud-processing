1. Ranger sensors

Active range sensors provide direct measurements from the sensor to
the objects in the environment.

主要测量的是传感器离objects的距离。

1.1 Active ranging sensors can be categorised into two groups.

1.1.1 time of flight systems
当前我使用的主要就是这种类型的。
Time of flight systems that calculate the distance to objects based on the propagation speed of
waves. 
Laser rangefinders use light as the electromagnetic signals to calculate the distance to objects.
They consists of a transmitter which emits the laser and a receiver capable of detecting the
reflected light. These sensors often are referred to as Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)
sensors. LiDAR is an optical remote sensing technology that measures the properties of scattered
light to find range and other information of a distant target. 

1.1.2 Second category is triangulation based active ranging systems.
这里不了解。

1.1.3 3D and 2D laser scanners

2D LiDAR systems use a mechanical system with a mirror to sweep the light to cover
a plane of the environment. 

Additionally the 3D systems use an extra rotational mechanism to
measure the environment in 3D. 就像Riegl，水平方向通过旋转来获得，竖直方向通过一个mirror来获得数据。
