Image projection is the process of mapping a curved surface on to a flat image. Representation
of the spherical view of the measured environment on a flat image requires the mapping of the
3D scene on a 2D medium.

1.1 Equirectangular
1.2 Cylindrical
1.3 Mercator
1.4 Rectilinear
1.5 Pannini
1.6 Stereographic
1.7 Z-axis
1.8 Albers Equal-Area Conic
1.9 Equal-Area Cylindrical
1.10 Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area

这里仅给一个清单，具体的实现没有看，如果以后用到再说。

The panorama images are generated from the color, reflectance and range information provided
by modern 3D laser measurement systems.
